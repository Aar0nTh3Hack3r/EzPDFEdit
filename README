- By Aar0nTh3Hack3r 

Simple PDF editor written in Python.
With this program you can modify in the PDF file the order of the pages.

* Requirements ( for Windows ):
    - Python 3 ( with tkinter )
    - Poppler  ( http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/ )

 ----- Installation ------

1. We need to install some python modules:
    Windows:
        pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
    Linux:
        sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    Mac:
        # I don't use Mac, idk. 

 ----- Usage ------

To start the program you need:
    * in Windows:
        - to drag and drop PDF files to the Python file
    * in Linux:
        - to open terminal, and write this command: python3 PDF.py 'whatever.pdf' 'whatever2.pdf' 'whateverN.pdf'
        ~ Sorry, I developered this program for Windows. :( It works on linux to, but you cann't open the files "eazily".

When the program is loaded, in screen appears 3 windows:
    1. Source PDF
    2. Output PDF
    3. Preview

You can:
    - put a page into output PDF by double clicking it on the source PDF.
    - delete a page from output PDF by double clicking it.
    - hide a page from input PDF by selecting it (clicking it), and than pressing Del.
    - move a page on the output pdf with right or left arrow.

Export:
    - when you press the Export button (or Ctrl + e), opens an anther window, where you can type the name of the output pdf.
    ~ If the PDF name dosn't ends with ".pdf", the program automatically add the ".pdf" extension.
